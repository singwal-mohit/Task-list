# Task-list
Simple task list app using javascript for addition of tasks. I used local storage for storing the tasks and upon refreshing the app does not loose the tasks added. You can
anytime press the cross icon to remove the tasks. Also I implemented filtering of tasks by typing any of the keywords all the tasks having the key words get filtered out.
